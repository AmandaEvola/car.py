# car.py
This is a basic Object-Oriented Python programming project that I created that focuses on the acceleration of a car which focuses on the 'Car' class with its own set of attributes and behavior while creating car objects and encapsulating attributes (make, model, year, color, speed), with 'my_car' as the object.
